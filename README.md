Using the Hacker News API, create a solution that allows users to view the newest stories from the feed.

Your solution must be developed using an Angular front-end app.

Do your best to implement the following:

A list of the newest stories
Each list item should include the title and a link to the news article. Watch out for stories that do not have hyperlinks!
A search feature that allows users to find stories
A paging mechanism. While we love reading, 200 stories on the page is a bit much.
Automated tests for your code
